# Disaster Alert & Travel Safety App

A government-operated platform designed to keep tourists and citizens safe during natural disasters and emergencies.  
The app provides **real-time alerts**, **safety guidance**, and **interactive incident reporting** through emoji-based quick inputs.



## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Disaster Alerts**: Receive official notifications from government authorities.
- **Interactive Map**: View affected areas mapped via satellite-linked GPS.
- **Emoji-Based Incident Reporting**: Quickly report hazards (e.g., 🌧️ Rain, ❄️ Snow, 🔥 Fire) by dragging icons onto the map.
- **Tourist Safety Guidance**: Get travel safety tips during emergencies.
- **Government Control**: Alerts are issued **only** by authorized agencies.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**:  
- Java Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MySQL Database  

**Frontend**:  
- Angular / React (planned)  

**Hosting & Deployment**:  
- AWS / GCP  



## 📌 How It Works

1. **Authorities** send verified alerts from the control dashboard.
2. **Users** receive instant push notifications and see incidents on a live map.
3. **Reports** can be submitted using drag-and-drop emoji markers.
4. **Backend** processes reports and updates the map in real-time.

## The Problem
1. Tourists face unpredictable disasters like landslides, floods, snowstorms, or protests.
2. Current systems are not user-friendly or accessible for non-locals.
3. Tourists lack knowledge of local language/terrain.
   
**Opportunity**: Governments need a real-time, multilingual platform for alerting tourists.
